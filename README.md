# I am Fatima ðŸ‘‹
I am a master-level biostatistics student with working experience in biomedical and healthcare analytics and familiarity in two coding languages, R and SAS. Also, I am open to learning other programming languages that are commonly used in data science like Python and SQL

In my github website, I add my personal and coursework projects using R and SAS. I am planning to add more projects in the upcoming weeks. Stay tuned ;)
